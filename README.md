# Regression Analysis

 This repository contains the solutions to 6 homework assignments in MATH 564, which is a graduate-level regression analysis course offered by Professor Maggie Cheng in Fall 2023 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I was a teaching assistant for the course, grading students' solutions.

The assignments include theoretical (mathematical proof) and coding questions. Each homework (HW) folder consists of:

* A PDF of questions
* A dataset (if needed)
* A PDF of solutions to theoretical questions
* Code files for coding questions.

Any comments or corrections are welcome. I would appreciate it if you could email me at [akirtisoglu@hawk.iit.edu](mailto:akirtisoglu@hawk.iit.edu)
