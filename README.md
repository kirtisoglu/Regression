# Regression Analysis

 This repository contains the solutions to 6 homework assignments in MATH 564, which is a graduate-level regression analysis course offered by Professor Maggie Cheng in Fall 2023 at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I was a teaching assistant for the course, grading students' solutions.

The assignments include theoretical (mathematical proof) and coding questions. Each homework (HW) folder consists of:

* A PDF of questions
* A dataset (if needed)
* A solution PDF of theoretical questions
* Code files for coding questions.
